Hello.  This is Split, an easy, cross-platform way to split up the bill that's both fun and intuitive.

Imagine we've just received our bill.  We can all open this app, and the person who will pay the bill to the restaurant
selects, "Start Split." 

This allows the billpayer to see their nearby Venmo friends, with whom they can select and begin their
transaction process.  

Once I select the friends I've eaten with, I take a picture of the receipt and segment it by dragging 
rectangles around each item.  

I can then swipe or flick each item to their respective buyer and consolidate an overall charge for each person.  

Once all the charges are distributed, the final payment can be made to the establishment through the Mastercard API.
