Hello.  This is Split, a cross-platform, easy way to split up the bill that's both fun and intuitive.
Imagine we just received our bill.  We all open this app and the person who will pay the bill
selects "Start Split." This allows the user to see their nearby venmo friends to select from and begin their
transaction process.  Once I select the friends I've eaten with, I take a picture of the receipt
and segment it by dragging rectangles around each item.  I then swipe or flick each item to their
respective buyer and consolidate an overall charge for each person.  Once all the charges are distributed, the 
final payment can be made and the establishment paid for their services using Mastercard API.
